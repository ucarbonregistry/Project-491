The project activity involves the installation of Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) cisterns constructed near
the homes of local community members. The Project Proponent, Acaatinga, adheres to all required rules
and regulations by the Brazilian ministry of Development and Social assistance, Family and fight against
Hunger. Each household is allotted its own distinct cistern, ensuring that the water user rights remain
with the local communities. 

The installed Rainwater Harvesting System is man-made constructed cisterns that conserve and stores
rainwater for future use in the rural area of the Crateús and Buriti dos Montes municipality. The plate
cistern is a type of cylindrical, covered and semi-buried water reservoir, which allows the capture and
storage of rainwater from its runoff on the roofs of houses, through the use of PVC gutters. The closed
reservoir is protected from evaporation and contamination caused by animals and waste brought by
floodwaters.

The program focuses on establishing a standardized approach to ensure quality construction and
minimize potential failures. The training on water management for human consumption and cistern
construction has been provided to the beneficiaries of individual households. Attendance is documented
through signed lists, capturing participant details and community identification, with records
maintained.

Construction teams consist of one farmer paid R$ 60.00 per day for five days and one helper at R$ 30.00
per day. Additionally, food costs for workers are R$ 17.00 per day during construction. This program
enhances community resilience by promoting sustainable water management practices through highquality cistern construction.
Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the process of collecting, conveying, and storing rainfall for future use. It
involves capturing rainwater from rooftops (roof water) which can then be reused for irrigation or other
domestic purposes. The collected rainwater is directed into storage facilities, which can vary in size small
for residential use and large for commercial and institutional applications.

The Project aims to improve living conditions for low-income families in rural areas by installing 16,000-
liter plate cisterns for rainwater collection and storage. Alongside this infrastructure, capacity-building
and training in water management are provided. By maintaining these systems, families can access
quality water more easily, reducing the need for long walks to find water and avoiding reliance on low-quality sources. Ultimately, these efforts not only enhance water access for human consumption but also contribute to food and nutritional security, fostering resilience in Brazil's semi-arid regions.
The training program for constructing cisterns aims to equip farmers with essential skills for building
plate cisterns. Teams of up to ten farmers participate in hands-on training, guided by an experienced
instructor who demonstrates construction techniques and procedures.
